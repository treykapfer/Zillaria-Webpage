# Zillaria-Webpage

I began this project after learning HTML/CSS fundamentals. I plan to revisit this project as a full stack webite - using MySQL + React, or full stack MERN, depending on if I wan't to bother with relationships in the DB, or just use it for dynamic rendering. I would have an admin login so me, and a few other worldbuilders could easily add entries into the website and have them render the new entry immediatley (basic CRUD stuff). It would be a heavily styled wikipedia-esque website.
